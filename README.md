# HearFromTheGuardian

This project is still in progress as free time playground. Idea of the project is letting user to hear latest news title (yes, only title unfortunately because I didn't check API documentation before starting to the project and thought that I can get whole news content but The Guardian API doesn't provide it.) from The Guardian via Javascript SpeechSyhtnesis API.

## Try via development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

But first you need to create your The Guardian api key from `https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer`.
